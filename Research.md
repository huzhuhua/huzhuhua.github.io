## 3. Research on multi-standard shared interleaver and wideband spectrum sensing technology (多标准共享交织器和宽带频谱感知技术研究)
<ol>
<p style="margin-top: 8px;">
A series of research results have been made in the field of wireless communication for wideband compressed spectrum sensing and shared design of multi-standard interleaver for 4G&5G. Firstly, the focus is on the mining of a priori information of wideband sparse signals, the methods to improve the reconstruction accuracy of support sets and the number of reconfigurable bands of signals, the strategies to reduce the hardware complexity of compressed sampling devices, the modeling of sensing and relay channels, and the security of spectrum sensing. And a series of research results are presented. Second, the interleaver module plays an important role in reducing the BER and improving the transmission efficiency of the fading channel. For 5G NR, a hardware multiplexing scheme of channel interleaver based on LDPC and Polar codes is proposed. A non-conflicting and parallelizable address addressing formula for control channel interleaving and data channel interleaving is derived, and a hardware implementation of the interleaver with a shared structure is given to achieve hardware reuse. Subsequently, interleaving and rate matching of turbo, convolutional, polar and LDPC coding in 4G and 5G are further investigated. For these four different standards, the address mapping formulas are optimized, the interleaving storage sharing and module sharing methods are proposed, the structure design of the shared modules is given, and the feasibility of the algorithms is demonstrated through experiments. And to some extent, hardware multiplexing of 4G and 5G communication links is realized.<br>
