(1) A series of work was carried out for fish characters analysis, including :(a) we design a series of algorithms and models based on traditional computer vision methods, machine learning methods and deep learning based classification and keypoint regression methods, respectively; (b) A practical software system and a set of intelligent measuring device have been developed. The above work has been demonstrated in economic production activities.<br>
(2) Some research results have been made on object detection, density estimation and small object detection in remote sensing images.<br>
(3) Work on intelligent monitoring of agricultural pests and diseases: Based on the study of computer vision algorithms and models, some progress has been made for intelligent segmentation and detection identification of pests and diseases. Firstly, an intelligent segmentation and detection model of disease and insects was constructed. Secondly, the intelligent detection method of disease spores was constructed. Finally, based on these models and methods, a set of intelligent pest and disease detection smart cart with autonomous map building and navigation was developed.<br>

Firstly, a set of long and short-term water quality prediction algorithm model was constructed, and a deep learning prediction method considering correlation was proposed for the first time. Secondly, a set of underwater fish behavior detection and early warning model was built. Finally, a complete set of underwater fish behavior detection and tracking, water quality monitoring and prediction IoT wisdom platform was constructed. The above work has been applied and demonstrated in Xincun Port, Lingshui County, Hainan Province, China, with good results.<br>
