在无线通信领域针对宽带压缩频谱感知和多标准交织器的共享设计做出了一些研究结果。首先，重点针对宽带稀疏信号先验信息的挖掘、支撑集重构精度和信号可重构频带数的提高方法、压缩采样设备硬件复杂度的降低策略、感知和中继信道的建模、以及频谱感知安全性等问题提出了相应的解决方案，并在研究中取得了一系列的研究结果。其次，交织器模块在降低误码率和提高衰减信道的传输效率方面起着重要作用。针对5G NR，提出了一种基于LDPC和Polar码的信道交织器的硬件复用方案。推导出了控制信道交织和数据信道交织的非冲突、可并行的地址寻址公式，给出了交织器的硬件实现共享结构，实现了硬件重用。随后，进一步研究了4G、5G中turbo、卷积、polar和LDPC编码的交织和速率匹配。对于这四种不同的标准，优化了地址映射公式，提出了交织存储共享和模块共享方法，给出了共享模块的结构设计，通过实验证明了算法的可行性。并在一定程度上实现了4G和5G通信链路的硬件复用。

<!-- A series of research results have been made in the field of wireless communication for wideband compressed spectrum sensing and shared design of multi-standard interleaver for 4G&5G. Firstly, the focus is on the mining of a priori information of wideband sparse signals, the methods to improve the reconstruction accuracy of support sets and the number of reconfigurable bands of signals, the strategies to reduce the hardware complexity of compressed sampling devices, the modeling of sensing and relay channels, and the security of spectrum sensing. And a series of research results are presented. Second, the interleaver module plays an important role in reducing the BER and improving the transmission efficiency of the fading channel. For 5G NR, a hardware multiplexing scheme of channel interleaver based on LDPC and Polar codes is proposed. A non-conflicting and parallelizable address addressing formula for control channel interleaving and data channel interleaving is derived, and a hardware implementation of the interleaver with a shared structure is given to achieve hardware reuse. Subsequently, interleaving and rate matching of turbo, convolutional, polar and LDPC coding in 4G and 5G are further investigated. For these four different standards, the address mapping formulas are optimized, the interleaving storage sharing and module sharing methods are proposed, the structure design of the shared modules is given, and the feasibility of the algorithms is demonstrated through experiments. And to some extent, hardware multiplexing of 4G and 5G communication links is realized. -->
